# Lego_Spike_Made_Easy

Lego Spike Made Easy is a resource for all those who don't like the lego spike python libraries or documentation.
The goal of this repository is to build a python extension that can make the tedious process of controlling a lego
spike system easy.

This is a living repository and commits are encouraged.
